# C2DNSServer
Collection of DNS Command and Control Servers for Red Teaming

C2DNSServer is a collection of DNS-based Command and Control (C2) servers designed for red teaming and penetration testing exercises. The project includes implementations in both C++ and Python, facilitating DNS-based communication channels for simulated adversarial operations.

    Disclaimer: This tool is intended for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Unauthorized use against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Features

- Multiple Implementations: Offers both C++ and Python versions to suit different operational needs.

- DNS-Based Communication: Utilizes DNS queries and responses to establish covert channels between the server and clients.

- Red Teaming Utility: Designed to aid red teams in simulating adversary behaviors and testing detection capabilities.

## Usage

- Client Interaction: Clients can communicate with the server by sending specially crafted DNS queries. The server responds with encoded commands or data.

- Data Encoding: Information exchanged between the client and server is encoded (e.g., Base64) to fit within DNS protocol constraints.

- Operational Security: When deploying in a testing environment, ensure proper network configurations and monitoring are in place to observe the C2 communications.
